# AI Mental Health Companion - Model Report

## Overview
This document describes the machine learning models used in the AI Mental Health Companion system.

## Models

### Text Emotion Model
- **Architecture**: DistilBERT-based transformer with classification head
- **Input**: Tokenized text sequences (max 512 tokens)
- **Output**: 6 emotion categories (anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise)
- **Training Data**: Emotion classification datasets
- **Performance**: ~85% accuracy on validation set

### Audio Emotion Model
- **Architecture**: LSTM-based recurrent neural network with feature extraction
- **Input**: Audio features (MFCC, spectral features, ZCR)
- **Output**: 7 emotion categories (neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust)
- **Training Data**: Speech emotion datasets (RAVDESS, TESS)
- **Performance**: ~78% accuracy on validation set

### Multimodal Fusion
- **Architecture**: Feed-forward neural network combining text, audio, and visual features
- **Purpose**: Integrate multiple modalities for more accurate emotion detection
- **Benefits**: Improved robustness and accuracy over single-modal approaches

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- User consent required for data processing
- Right to data deletion implemented

### Bias Mitigation
- Models trained on diverse datasets
- Regular bias auditing performed
- Fairness metrics monitored across demographic groups

### Transparency
- Explainable AI techniques used (LIME, SHAP)
- Model decisions made interpretable to users
- Clear limitations communicated

## Performance Monitoring
- Continuous monitoring of model accuracy
- A/B testing for model improvements
- User feedback integration for model refinement

## Future Improvements
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving training
- Personalized model adaptation
- Integration of additional modalities (physiological signals)
